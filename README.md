# Hackathon- HackThisFall

# Our Aim-
 We aim to provide safety from online frauds and assaults. Many people suffer from online crime on daily basis.
They have nowhere to go. Many girls are afraid to share their problems. Many older people don't have enough knowledge about it.
They don't know where to go, whom to reach in such cases. Therefore, we bring a platform where they can get all their queries resolved.
Our aim to provide such a resources to those people who are helpless in some ways. 
They are not educated enough to handle such cases by themselves.

# Our inspiration behind this website
We felt that there is a high need for cyber security in today's time. 
There are many platforms but they are careless while handling such cases. 
Many cases don't even reach too high authorities due to a lack of knowledge.
So this was our inspiration behind this website.

# Challenges we ran into
While developing the website, there were times when we had no idea how to build some components.
We faced difficulty while developing the podcast page and connecting it to the backend.
We have issues in hosting the website.

# How we solved the challenges
We searched about the issues and asked our team members. We took help from mentors. And eventually, we were able to solve the issues.

# Future scope of our website
We are planning to connect our website to an NGO. 
We are planning to add a backend to our website in future so that users can make the best use of it.
We will take permission from cyber cell to move forward with our website.
